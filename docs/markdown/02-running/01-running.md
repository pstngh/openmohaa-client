# Running the game

## Game selection

**Medal of Honor: Allied Assault** is the default game, but expansions are also supported.

### Start using launchers

Base game and expansions can be started from one of the 3 launchers:

- `launch_openmohaa_base`, use this to play **Medal of Honor: Allied Assault**
- `launch_openmohaa_spearhead`, use this to play **Medal of Honor: Allied Assault: Spearhead**
- `launch_openmohaa_breakthrough`, use this to play **Medal of Honor: Allied Assault: Breakthrough**

### Start from the command-line

**Spearhead** and **Breakthrough** are supported in OpenMoHAA using the `com_target_game` variable.

To change the target game, append the following command-line arguments to the `openmohaa` and `omohaaded` executable:

- `+set com_target_game 0` for the default base game (mohaa, uses `main` folder)
- `+set com_target_game 1` for the Spearhead expansion (mohaas, uses `mainta` folder)
- `+set com_target_game 2` for the Breakthrough expansion (mohaab, uses `maintt` folder)

OpenMoHAA will also use the correct network protocol version accordingly. The default value of `com_target_game` is 0.

On Windows, a shortcut can be created to the `openmohaa` executable, with the command-line argument appended from above to play an expansion.

### Using a demo version

The argument `+set com_target_demo 1` must be appended to command-line to play the game or host a server using demo assets. Allied Assault, Spearhead and Breakthrough demos are supported.

## User data location

Game configuration files are stored beside the binaries by default, under
`main/configs/omconfig.cfg` for Allied Assault, `mainta/configs/omconfig.cfg`
for Spearhead, or `maintt/configs/omconfig.cfg` for Breakthrough. For example,
an installation at `/plex/documents/mohaa` stores the base-game config at
`/plex/documents/mohaa/main/configs/omconfig.cfg`, regardless of the process's
working directory. The installation folder must be writable to save settings.
After upgrading from a build that stored configs in the user data directory,
copy the existing `omconfig.cfg` into the matching installation subdirectory
to keep your settings.

Other user-writable data, like the console logfile and saves, is stored in a
platform-specific directory:

- `%APPDATA%\openmohaa` on Windows
- `~/.openmohaa` on Linux
- `~/Library/Application Support/openmohaa` on macOS

There will be one or more subdirectories matching the game being used: `main`
for the base game or `mainta`/`maintt` for the expansions.

If necessary, the location of all user-writable data, including configuration
files, can be changed by setting `fs_homepath` on the command line. The value
can be a relative path (relative to the current working directory) or an
absolute path. Examples:
- `+set fs_homepath Z:\openmohaa_data` data will be written inside the fully qualified path `Z:\openmohaa_data`
- `+set fs_homepath homedata` will use the subfolder `homedata` in the process current working directory to write data (will be created automatically)
- `+set fs_homepath .` not recommended, will write data inside the process current working directory

To move only configuration files, set `fs_homeconfigpath` instead.

Note that the configuration file isn't created nor written automatically on a dedicated server (**omohaaded**).
